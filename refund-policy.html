            <h2>What you purchased</h2>
            <p>A one-day pass for £3.99 gives you access to the Tellme web app for 24 hours from the time of purchase.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-section">
            <h2>Requesting a refund</h2>
            <p>You can request a refund at any time within 24 hours of your purchase. Simply tap 'Refund' in the app to submit your request. You do not need to enter your access code. If you have any difficulty, you can also contact us at <a href="mailto:support@tell-me.ai">support@tell-me.ai</a>.</p>
            <p>We handle refund requests manually, but we usually quickly approve them unless there is an issue with the purchase record.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-section">
            <h2>What happens after you request a refund</h2>
            <p>Your access to the app will continue until your 24-hour window naturally ends.</p>
            <p>Refunds are issued to the original payment method. They usually appear within 3 to 5 business days, but your bank may take up to 10 business days to show the funds.</p>
