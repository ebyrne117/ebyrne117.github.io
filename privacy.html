                <h2>2. LEGAL BASIS FOR DATA COLLECTION</h2>

                <h3>2.1. Types of Data / Privacy Policy Scope</h3>
                <p>"Personal Data" means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).</p>
                
                <p>We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of Personal Data about you which we have grouped together below. Not all of the following types of data will necessarily be collected from you but this is the full scope of data that we collect and when we collect it from you.</p>
                
                <p>We do not collect any Special Categories of Personal Data about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health, and genetic and biometric data). Nor do we collect any information about criminal convictions and offences.</p>

                <h3>2.2. The Legal Basis for Collecting Data</h3>
                <p>There are a number of justifiable reasons under the GDPR that allow collection and processing of Personal Data. The main avenues we rely on are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Consent": Certain situations allow us to collect your Personal Data, such as when you tick a box that confirms you are happy to receive email newsletters from us, or 'opt in' to a service.</li>
                    <li>"Contractual Obligations": We may require certain information from you in order to fulfil our contractual obligations and provide you with the promised service.</li>
                    <li>"Legal Compliance": We're required by law to collect and process certain types of data, such as fraudulent activity or other illegal actions.</li>
                    <li>"Legitimate Interest": We might need to collect certain information from you to be able to meet our legitimate interests - this covers aspects that can be reasonably expected as part of running our business, that will not have a material impact on your rights, freedom or interests. Examples could be your address, so that we know where to deliver something to, or your name, so that we have a record of who to contact moving forwards.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

                <h2>3. HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h2>

                <h3>3.1. Our data uses</h3>
                <p>We will only use your Personal Data when the law allows us to. Typically, we use your data in the following ways: to provide our service, to communicate with you, to improve our service, to ensure security and prevent fraud or to fulfil legal or regulatory requirements.</p>

                <h3>3.2. Change of purpose</h3>
                <p>We will only use your Personal Data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us.</p>
                
                <p>If we need to use your Personal Data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.</p>
                
                <p>Please note that we may process your Personal Data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.</p>

                <h2>4. YOUR RIGHTS AND HOW YOU ARE PROTECTED BY US</h2>

                <h3>4.1. Your legal rights</h3>
                <p>Under certain circumstances, you have the following rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Right to be informed.</strong> You have a right to be informed about our purposes for processing your personal data, how long we store it for, and who it will be shared with. We have provided this information to you in this policy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Right of access.</strong> This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to rectification.</strong> You have a right to request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected.</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to erasure.</strong> You have the right to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to object.</strong> You can object to the processing of personal data we hold about you.</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to restrict processing.</strong> You have the right to request the restriction or suppression of their personal data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to data portability.</strong> You have the right to request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4.2. How Tellme AI Limited protects customers' Personal Data</h3>
                <p>We are concerned with keeping your data secure and protecting it from inappropriate disclosure. Any Personal Data collected by us is only accessible by a limited number of employees who have special access rights to such systems and are bound by obligations of confidentiality. If and when we use subcontractors to store your data, we will not relinquish control of your Personal Data or expose it to security risks that would not have arisen had the data remained in our possession. However, unfortunately no transmission of data over the internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under the control of Tellme AI Limited to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully. While we strive to protect your Personal Data, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any Personal Data you transmit to us. Any such transmission is done at your own risk. If you believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, please contact us.</p>

                <h3>4.3. How to request your data and the process for obtaining it</h3>
                <p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, if your request is clearly unfounded, we could refuse to comply with your request. We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure you have the right to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that Personal Data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response. We aim to respond within one month.</p>
